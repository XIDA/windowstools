restarter
============

This tool will first kill the task of a specific program, then start the program again.

Let's say you have a program called ToolY and from time to time it freezes. Then you open task manager, kill the task and then you start the program again. The restarter can do this for you.

###Install###
1. Copy the restarter.exe and restarter.txt to your desired location
2. rename both files to the program you want to restart, like restartToolY.exe and restartToolY.txt
3. open the .txt file and 
	* in the first line enter the name of the task you want to kill (you can find that in the task manager) like ToolY.exe
	* in the second line enter the path to the exe file you want to start like C:\Program Files (x86)\ToolY\ToolY.exe
