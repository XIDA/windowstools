ftpUploader
============

Upload files from the right-click context menu and copy the url into the clipboard afterwards



###Install###
Open ftpUploader.ini and fill in the ftp data.

Also add the base url.
This is the url where your files are located on the web.
So if your ftp points to http://yoururl.com/ than add this url here.
When the upload is finished the complete url will be copied to the clipboard, e.g. http://yoururl.com/yourfile.zip

Now run the ftpUploader.exe and it will ask you to import the necessary registry settings to add itself to the context menu.

Afterwards you can right-click any file in file explorer and select "ftpUploader"
