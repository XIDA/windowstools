Displayport Helper
============

There is an annoying problem with monitors connected to Windows 7 / 8 via Displayport: When the Displayport monitor is turned off or goes into standby then Windows moves all your open windows around.

This tool tries to solve that problem.

From the try icon you can save and restore the open windows' positions.
